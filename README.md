** This is the front-end for the Made With Love Project **

# Concept :
Made with love is a website that supports homemade businesses by providing them with space (online store ) to showcase and sell their unique products, introducing them to a larger market, and offering them the chance to grow and develop their businesses in a competitive and inspiring environment.

While also providing the consumers of homemade products with an easy to access and all-inclusive market where they can find any homemade product they may need in one place, one website, with an easy to order system.
